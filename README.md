# **About**

This mod removes certain recipes from crafting benches. Initially it was made to remove weapon coatings from the crafting tables as they are unbalanced and can be abused to farm early. 
I've left the weapon coatings prefabs in the code as an example but can be removed if you'd like with the commands under. 
It's open source and can be used by anyone, just give credits if you plan to use the code, reference it, or any changes.
## **Commands**

.Recipe add - Adds a recipe to the block list

.Recipe remove - Removes a recipe from the block list

.Recipe list - lists all recipes in the file

.Recipe reload - reloads the mod in case you've edited it from the file

## **Prefabs**

Please read the Wiki regarding all the recipes you can remove from the crafting

## **Credits**

This mod only exists from the help of the Hellsing admin team and community for the suggestions and ideas to help fix the issue of unbalanced recipes. 

Thank you to Odjit for the help regarding how to set this up and updates to VCF.
